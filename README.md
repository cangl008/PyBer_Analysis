# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
 The purpose of the new analysis is to summarize and show, using figures, how the data differs depending on the city type that the ride share is in. These differences will hopefully be used by the higher-ups to make positive changes to increase profit as well as accessibility. 
 
 ## Results

Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type.Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

Based on the data provided the ride-sharing is significantly more succesful in urban cities in terms of amount of rides, amount of drives and the total fares.  With the data provider of a over 2,000 rides over 1,000 of those rides were from urban cities. Rural cities only accounted for a little over 100 rides. This disparencey could be explained with the amount of driver each city type has; rural:78 , suburban:490, urban:2405. Urban city ride share drivers account for about 80% of the total ride share drivers.

The majority of the fares also came from urban cities totaling at $39,854, thats a little more than half of the total fares for all cities. Rural cities total fare was only $4,327 about 7% of total fares amount of all cities.
